I reached 5 digit in osu! sometime in 2023 and climbed to #25k, but I haven't been playing seriously since. [Here's my profile](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/20865209).

Nowadays I mostly play maimai DX, unnamed-sdvx-clone, beatoraja, and sometimes ADOFAI, Beat Saber, vivid/stasis, Arcaea, Cytus II, Phigros, and プロセカ. In 2025, [I made my own Sound Voltex and IIDX controllers](#).

I play modern Tetris. [Here's my TETR.IO profile](http://ch.tetr.io/u/65_7a).

I play Minecraft. I used to be active on [Hypixel](https://plancke.io/hypixel/player/stats/65_7a), where I reached iron prestige in Bedwars. I also used to be active on [Wynncraft](https://wynncraft.com/stats/player/835bbeb7-4ee5-44d0-9a06-9bba0d475b19). Now, I mostly play technical modpacks or vanilla on servers with friends. I got into factory games through modded Minecraft, specifically the Valhelsia 3 modpack. My favourite modpack is [Monifactory](https://github.com/ThePansmith/Monifactory).

I occasionally play Hoyoverse games, Wuthering Waves, and Reverse: 1999.

Some of my favourite games I've played are Terraria, Bitburner, Factorio, Mindustry, RimWorld, Touhou Luna Nights, ULTRAKILL, UNDERTALE, DELTARUNE, OMORI, the Yakuza series, and the Judgment series.
