<ProseLayout title={frontmatter.title}>

I practice photography as a hobby with a Canon EOS 700D I bought in 2025. I first used a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W110 when I was 8 years old, and then I inherited a Sony Cyber-shot RX100 III. Somewhere along the way, I [started to take photography more seriously](/photography).

I spend a lot of time in front of the computer. I have a [PC](/pc-parts) I built, an old MacBook, and a repurposed Intel 4th-gen PC as a [homelab](/homelab).

I primarily write code in Java and JavaScript. I build desktop apps, web apps, Minecraft mods/plugins, and robots at [The Drop Bears](https://www.thedropbears.org.au/). I'm currently learning Android app development with Kotlin.

I occasionally play [video games](/games).

I listen to a lot of Artcore and VOCALOID. [See what I've recently listened to](/music).

My other hobbies include fountain pens, astronomy, badminton, [watching anime and reading manga](https://anilist.co/user/dondokodokodoko).
