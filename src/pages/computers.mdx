# Hardware

I built my current PC in 2022, right after the AM5 platform released. I chose AM4, because I didn't see myself needing anything more. I chose a NVIDIA GPU for ML/AI.

I also have a homelab consisting of a Intel 4th-gen PC repurposed as a server.

# Software

When I was little, I made the very first version of this website in my dad's office with plain HTML and CSS. You'd probably believe me if I said I haven't learn anything else since then, but despite the appearance of this website, I know modern JavaScript. Astro, React and Vue for the front end and Node for the backend.

I wanted to make shitty Minecraft mods, so I learnt some Java and made my first Forge mod (back when NeoForge wasn't a thing, or even Modrinth) without even having a Minecraft account. I eventually learnt Fabric as well as Bukkit/Spigot for server plugins, but I haven't made any notable projects with any.

Knowing Java, I made a few things like REST APIs with Spring Boot and some desktop apps with Java Swing. I also learnt a bit of Kotlin for Android development.

I'm now trying to develop closer to the hardware, learning Rust as a low-level language.
