<ProseLayout title={frontmatter.title}>
I prefer to use overengineered, nice looking and somewhat expensive stationery where possible. I do this to make my life slightly less miserable during classes. I don't write much with pen and paper outside of school.

I've had an obsession with fountain pens ever since my trip to Japan in 2024 ([photos](#)). I bought two Pilot Kakuno pens (one in F and one in M) along with some Pilot Black, Pilot Blue, Pilot Red, and Pilot Iroshizuku Tsuki-yo cartridges. Some time later, I bought a Jinhao Shark and a Jinhao X159 (both in F), and a bottle each of Diamine's Imperial Purple and Waterman Serenity Blue.

If I'm not using my fountain pens, I use a uni Jetstream 2&1 0.5mm ballpoint and my Zebra Sarasa Dry 0.4mm gel pens. I use Zebra's Mildliner highlighters and some Tombow glue tape.
