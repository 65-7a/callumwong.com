I first used a digital camera when I was very little for my first school camp. It was a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W110, a basic but functional point-and-shoot camera which was more than enough for 8-year-old me to play around with. Somewhere along the way I was allowed to use my dad's much more capable point-and-shoot camera, a Sony Cyber-shot RX100 III, which I shot about 4,000 photos with.

In 2023, I watched [Insomniacs After School](https://anilist.co/anime/143653/Kimi-wa-Houkago-Insomnia), the anime adaptation of the manga which would soon become [my favourite manga of all time](https://anilist.co/manga/110473/Kimi-wa-Houkago-Insomnia/). The main character, Nakami Ganta, uses a Canon 5D Mark IV. The manga inspired me to learn the basics of photography and post-processing. I practiced with the RX100, and I took a star trail composite astrophoto at my year 9 camp, inspired by Ganta at Mitsukejima in episode 11.

I was proud of myself for achieving this, so I began to take photography a little more seriously. I wanted to take macro and telephoto pictures, as well as astrophotography through attaching the body directly to a telescope. I also started to notice some annoying artifacts which were especially visible when taking photos of bright things, like the sky. And so I eventually grew out of the RX100, wanting a proper DSLR.

My dad gave me his Canon EOS 400D (Digital Rebel XTi) with a Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens. He said he stopped using the camera because it "only worked intermittently". Some quick testing showed that the camera would produce an `Err99` message, but only when the aperture was set to the non-widest f-stop. Further research showed that issues with aperture are common with this lens, and testing another lens at a camera store confirmed that it wasn't an issue with the body.

As of writing on the 28th of April, I haven't attemped to replace the aperture flex cable in the lens, although I plan to try soon.

I bought a Canon 70-210mm lens second hand, and will hopefully use it to take some nice photos in a coming trip.
